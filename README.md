# We Have The MEETS!

We Have the Meets is like [whentomeet](https://www.when2meet.com/) and [whenisgood](https://whenisgood.net/), but better. No longer do you have to fill out your schedule repetitively for each potential meeting. We Have the Meets seamlessly integrates your personal calendar on iCal, Google Calendar, and Outlook so that adding your availability is quick and easy. 

Check us out, and pray that Arby's doesn't sue us.
